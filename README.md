A solution for shperical2fisheye projection inside TouchDesigner.

Spherical map (equirectangular) projection to fisheye - originally for fulldome production.

Source of inspiration and testpatterns/images for proofing the result:
https://paulbourke.net/dome/2fish/ - Thanks to Paul Bourke! If you are looking into fulldome/dome rendering questions, his website is a great source!

sphere2fish_tox : 
- Plug in spherical map and polar coordinates (normalized between -1 and +1) or do not. 
- Activate the Viewer in the bottom-right corner and move the yellow box around - moving the zenith.

Performance:
- You can adjust the Rendering Anti-Alias for the RenderTOP inside the .tox (probably that should be a CustomParameter of the .tox)
